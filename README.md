Creating webpage to display datebase information
What my project is, is a party finder web app, what you will be able to do is view parties in certain
location based on the city you selected. When you selected a city it will show the current parties, the breif message,
the type of party, and address of that party

Bonus:
I added a time feature that display time every ten seconds in the webpage using web.mcv, to view time click on the time button in the nav bar
